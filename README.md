Galaxia is a 2D sidecrolling shooter inspired by classic arcade games like Galaga and Gradius developed through late 2024 to early 2025 in the Unity engine as the main and final project created for my university course's 2D Game Development module.

**How to Play:**
* WASD to Move

* Space to Fire

# Gameplay:

* Players control a spaceship that can move horizontally and fire energy lazers as enemy ships and dodge obstacles like small asteriods and giant rock caverns.

* Enemys drop coloured orbs that affect the players in different ways:

  

**Red - Power:**
* Every 5 red orbs collected increase the player's weapons. At first this means the player laser firing faster, later levels include extra lazers.​

​

**Blue - Speed**
* Every 5 blue orbs collected ups the speed of the player ship's movement.​

​

**Green - Extra Life:** 
* Collecting 3 green power ups gives the player an extra life.
